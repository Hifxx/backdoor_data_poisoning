# Backdoor Attacks on CIFAR10

This is a simple Resnet for CIFAR implementation supporting the detection of
backdoor attacks with spectral signatures.


- `train.py` trains
- `eval.py` evals once (`--loop` flag for infinite loop)
- `config.json` has all the options
- `compute_corr` performs the spectral signature detection
